# Problem Statement
Develop a simple application in core Java that demonstrates the use of MultiThreading to handle concurrent tasks efficiently. The application should simulate a scenario where multiple tasks are executed concurrently.
1. Implement a task that simulates some work (e.g., processing data, making network calls, or performing calculations). The task should include a random delay to mimic real-world operations.
2. Use a mechanism to coordinate and monitor the execution of these tasks, ensuring all tasks complete successfully.
3. Collect and display statistics about task execution, such as the total number of tasks, the time taken to complete all tasks, and any errors encountered.
4. Create unit test cases to test both failure and successful scenarios.

Please ensure your code is well-documented and includes clear instructions on how to run the application and the tests.
